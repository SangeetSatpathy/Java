//We use the EventListener interface, which contains methods(that we need to completely override and specify) that receive user input of a specific type. Each type of user input has a different sub-interface(such as ActionListener and ItemListener).
//For each input method, you need to add an EventListener. To do this, you must make the whole class as an implementation of that type of EventListener interface. You can then call the addActionListener() method for the ActionListener, or the addKeyListener() method for the KeyListener interface, etc.
